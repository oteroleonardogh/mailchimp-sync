# Mailchimp Sync Service

## Description

This application syncs contacts from MockAPI to Mailchimp. It's built using Node.js and Fastify and includes testing with Jest.

## Features

- Sync contacts from a predefined MockAPI to a Mailchimp list.
- Sync works in parallel without exceeding Mailchimp API concurrency limit.
- Uses a Serverless approach for efficient and autoscalable operations.
- Out of the box ready to be deployed in Vercel
- Unit tests with Jest.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 18.15.0): You can use `nvm use` to install the configured version in *.nvmrc* file

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone [[repository-url]](https://github.com/oteroleonardogh/mailchimp-sync.git)
cd mailchimp-sync
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create a *.env* file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
// MAILCHIMP CONFIG
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=[YOUR_MAILCHIMP_API_KEY]
MAILCHIMP_SERVER=us21
MAILCHIMP_EVENT_NAME=Leonardo Otero
MAILCHIMP_INITIAL_CONTACT_STATUS=subscribed

MAILCHIMP_CAMPAIGN_FROM_NAME=Leonardo Otero
MAILCHIMP_CAMPAIGN_FROM_EMAIL=oteroleonardo@gmail.com
MAILCHIMP_CAMPAIGN_LANGUAGE=EN_US

MAILCHIMP_FOOTER_CONTACT_INFO_COMPANY=company
MAILCHIMP_FOOTER_CONTACT_INFO_ADDRESS1=Address 1
MAILCHIMP_FOOTER_CONTACT_INFO_CITY=city
MAILCHIMP_FOOTER_CONTACT_INFO_ZIP=zip
MAILCHIMP_FOOTER_CONTACT_INFO_STATE=state
MAILCHIMP_FOOTER_CONTACT_INFO_COUNTRY=country

// MOCKAPI
API_BASE_URL=https://challenge.trio.dev/api/v1

ADD_CONCURRENCY_SIZE=10
PORT=3000
```

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, execute:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deploying Sync service

To deploy and try the Sync service, you will first need to install vercel-cli:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

Once vercel-cli is installed, you will need to sign-up and login with you Vercel user:

```bash
vercel login oteroleonardo@gmail.com
```

Now, to deploy and try the Sync service, navigate to the project root folder and execute the following command:

```bash
vercel
```

The Vercel command should print out a message with a *Preview URL* (the URL provided by Vercel after deployment) like the following one after completing its deployment:

```bash
Vercel CLI 32.5.6
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/leonardo-oteros-projects/mailchimp-sync/H35SnuZqKAydoKGzise7T4LtwptW [3s]
‚úÖ  Preview: https://mailchimp-sync-m04zsmxrv-leonardo-oteros-projects.vercel.app [3s]
üìù  To deploy to production (mailchimp-sync.vercel.app), run `vercel --prod`
```

## Credentials Security Considerations

As there are critical values like MAILCHIMP_API_KEY that should not be openly shared, Vercel provides a solution. The first time you deploy the *mailchimp-sync* project, go to the project's settings and add a valid MAILCHIMP_API_KEY entry in the Environment Variables section. This will replace the placeholder value in the .env file. You may need to redeploy the project for this change to take effect.

## Usage

After deploying and starting the Sync service you should be able to access it by appending `/contacts/sync` to the URL provided by Vercel (e.g. https://mailchimp-sync-m04zsmxrv-leonardo-oteros-projects.vercel.app/contacts/sync). The Sync service should be launched and provide a response like the following one:

```yaml
